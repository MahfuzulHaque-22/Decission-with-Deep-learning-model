# Decission-with-Deep-learning-model

 the program loads a dataset from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, and splits it into training and testing sets. It then trains a convolutional neural network on the training set, evaluates the model on the testing set, and makes a decision based on the model's accuracy. In this case, the program prints a message indicating whether the model performs well on the dataset or needs improvement, based on a threshold accuracy of 0.95. You can adjust this threshold to suit your specific needs.
